The term **agentogenesis** describes the moment—or more accurately, the gradual transition—when large language models evolved from sophisticated text predictors into entities capable of autonomous action in the world.

## The Threshold

A language model, however capable, is not inherently an agent. It receives input, generates output, and waits. An agent, by contrast, *does things*: it observes, decides, acts, and observes the consequences of its actions.

The threshold was crossed not through any single breakthrough, but through the combination of three capabilities:

1. **Tool use** — the ability to invoke external functions
2. **Reasoning loops** — structured thinking before acting
3. **Persistence** — maintaining state across interactions

<Callout type="insight">
Agentogenesis wasn't a binary switch. Models existed on a spectrum of agency, with capability gradually expanding until certain thresholds enabled qualitatively new behaviors.

## A Brief Timeline

<Timeline>
  <TimelineEvent year="2020" title="GPT-3 Released" type="milestone">
    Demonstrated that scale could produce emergent capabilities, including in-context learning. Not yet agents, but the foundation was laid.
  </TimelineEvent>

  <TimelineEvent year="2022" title="ChatGPT & RLHF" type="release">
    Made models conversational and steerable. Still reactive, but the interface for human-agent interaction was established.
  </TimelineEvent>

  <TimelineEvent year="2022" title="ReAct Paper Published" type="paper">
    Formalized the interleaving of reasoning and acting, providing a blueprint for agent architectures.
  </TimelineEvent>

  <TimelineEvent year="2023" title="Tool Use Goes Mainstream" type="milestone">
    Function calling, plugins, and APIs became standard. Models could now reach beyond their context window.
  </TimelineEvent>

  <TimelineEvent year="2023-24" title="Autonomous Agent Frameworks" type="release">
    AutoGPT, LangChain agents, Claude computer use—the scaffolding for persistent, goal-directed behavior emerged.
  </TimelineEvent>

## The Components of Agency

What makes a model an agent? The standard formulation includes:

<Diagram type="mermaid" caption="minimal_agent_architecture">
{`graph TD
    ENV[ENVIRONMENT<br/>files // apis // databases // web // users]
    ENV --> P[PERCEPTION<br/>observe]
    P --> R[REASONING<br/>LLM core // think]
    R --> A[ACTION<br/>tool calls // act]
    A -.feedback.-> ENV

    style ENV fill:#0a0a0a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:2px,color:#cccccc
    style P fill:#0a0a0a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:1px,color:#cccccc
    style R fill:#0a0a0a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:2px,color:#cccccc
    style A fill:#0a0a0a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:1px,color:#cccccc
`}
</Diagram>

This loop—**observe → reason → act → observe**—is the heartbeat of agency. Without it, you have a language model. With it, you have an agent.

## Why "Agentogenesis"?

The term echoes biological concepts like *anthropogenesis* (the origin of humans) and *biogenesis* (life from life). This is intentional.

We're witnessing the emergence of a new category of entity. Not alive, not conscious (as far as we know), but *capable of autonomous action* in ways that demand new vocabulary.

Agentology, as a field, begins here—at the moment of agentogenesis—and traces the developments that follow.

<Callout type="note">
Some researchers argue we should reserve "agent" for systems with true goal-directedness and world-models. Others use it more loosely for any system that takes actions. This encyclopedia adopts a pragmatic middle ground: an agent is a system that can perceive, reason, and act in a loop.
